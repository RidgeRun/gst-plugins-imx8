GStreamer IMX8 Plugins uses a *large* array of tools and libraries,
most of which are optional. We have attempted to make sure that any
code that depends on optional libraries doesn't get built unless you
have those libraries. If you find this not to be the case, please, let
us know by filing a bug report at
https://github.com/RidgeRun/gst-plugins-imx8/issues

Required tools:
===============

An extra set of tools is required if you wish to build GStreamer
from git (using autogen.sh):

autoconf  >= 2.68   https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
automake  >= 1.11   https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
gettext   >= 0.17   https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/
libtool   >= 2.2.6  https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/
pkgconfig >= 0.9.0  https://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/

Required libraries:
===================

Package:        GStreamer
Version:        1.x (same 1.x version as this package)
Recommended:    Latest 1.x
URL:            http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/
DebianPackage:  libgstreamer1.0-dev
Notes:          The required version is updated frequently, so the version
                listed in this file is often out of date. If you are compiling
                from git master, you will usually need GStreamer core and
                gst-plugins-base from git master as well.

Package:        GStreamer Base Plugins
Version:        1.x (same 1.x version as this package)
Recommended:    Latest 1.x
URL:            http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/
DebianPackage:  libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev
Notes:          The required version is updated frequently, so the version
                listed in this file is often out of date. If you are compiling
                from git master, you will usually need GStreamer core and
                gst-plugins-base from git master as well.


Optional libraries:
===================

This file lists supporting libraries for which gst-plugins-good contains
plugins, as well as their minimum required version. You can find the
corresponding plugins in ext/(library)

Package:        Orc
Version:        >= 0.4.17
Recommended:    Latest 0.4.x
URL:            http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/src/orc/
DebianPackage:  liborc-0.4-dev
Notes:		Used by many plugins for accelerating SIMD processing using
                run-time generated assembly. Not a hard requirement, but
                highly recommended. Packagers, please hard-depend on liborc.
                The git repository is http://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/orc/
                (all versions on entropywave.com are outdated)

Optional (debian) packages:
===========================

gtk-doc-tools >= 1.12  -- needed to build documentation
python-xml  -- needed to build plugin documentation
